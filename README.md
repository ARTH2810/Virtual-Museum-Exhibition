# Virtual-Museum-Exhibition
The Virtual Museum Exhibition is a half-completed project I began in my first year. Initially paused as I explored other tech, I’ve recently returned to enhance it. It features an interactive art gallery, modals with artwork info, and a 360° panoramic tour, reflecting my learning journey in web development.
