# Virtual-Museum-Exhibition
The Virtual Museum Exhibition is a half-completed project I began in my first year. Initially paused as I explored other tech, I’ve recently returned to enhance it. It features an interactive art gallery, modals with artwork info, and a 360° panoramic tour, reflecting my learning journey in web development.
Current Features:

🖼️ Interactive Art Gallery
A responsive grid displays iconic artworks such as The Starry Night, Mona Lisa, and The Persistence of Memory. Clicking on any piece opens a modal with details about the artwork.

🔊 Audio Narration (Planned)
The modal is designed to support audio playback, allowing users to listen to guided narrations about each piece for a richer experience. This feature is under development.

🌐 360° Virtual Tour
Using PhotoSphereViewer.js, users can now explore a panoramic view, simulating a virtual museum environment. This immersive addition allows users to feel like they’re walking through an actual exhibit.

💻 Clean and Responsive Design
The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile, offering smooth animations, hover effects, and modern styling to enhance user experience.

What Makes It Unique:
This project is important to me because it marks the beginning of my journey as a developer. Although it remained incomplete for a long time, returning to it allowed me to apply my improved knowledge and push its potential further. It now stands as a mix of my early creativity and recent technical growth.
